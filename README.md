Reproducing SPARC for Vision and Language at PSU

First it is recommended to run all cells in the jupyter notebook SPARC.ipynb, Run all should take care of everything from cloning the appropriate repository, setting up dependencies, downloading and unzipping datasets, as well as running both the original version and the version that was modified in an attempt to improve the results (unsuccessfully).

It is recommended to do so within a python environment however it is not necessary.

The only files that are worth mentioning are SPARC.ipynb, which is the be all end all script, the run_SPARC.py code which runs the original code provided by the authors, and the run_SPARC_mod1.py which runs the code I have modified.

The results can be seen in the notebook even without needing to run anything.

The gdown commands are to download the datasets, these were provided by the authors however they were individually provided and there were too many of these so I zipped them and uploaded to my own drive for ease of download and reproducibility.

Note some changes may be visible in the SPARC subdirectory which was forked from the original so some testing can be done with potential improvements
